This is a Tileset Pack with improved NSMBW tilesets.
It is still not finished. There are still some tilesets that might need some fixes but here are a few for now.

This Pack includes:
- tilesetinfo.xml: A file that you can paste into the a patch folder inside the reggiedata folder (DO NOT REPLACE THE   TILESETINFO.XML INSIDE THE REGGIEDATA FOLDER BECAUSE THAT WILL CAUSE AN ERROR)
- randtilegen.rb: The randomization file that is used inside Newer. It can be edited and needs to be compiled using Ruby
- RandTiles.bin: An already compiled randomization file that can be pasted into the NewerRes folder.

QUICK INFO
This pack was made by B1 Gaming. If you use any of my tilesets be sure to credit me as they took me quite some time to fix. Especially the underground tilesets considering I had to do it 3 times. So again if you use any tilesets credit me.
