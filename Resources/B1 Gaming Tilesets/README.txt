This Tileset Pack includes every tileset that exists in NSMBU. It even features some tilesets that were custom made by me.
This tileset Pack includes:
       -An Animation file called "animTiles.bin" for the NewerRes folder
       -A randomization file called "randtilegen.bin" that you can paste into the randomization file from the newer sources.
       -A randomization file called "tilesetinfo.xml" that you can copy and paste into reggiedata folder.
       -A tileset list for reggie (Zementblock inspired me to make this) called "tilesets.xml" that you can copy and paste in the reggiedata folder if you want and need to.
       -A changelog where you can inform yourself about the updates this tilesetpack has gotten.
       -A standard tileset list for you to know which tileset is which (With references to a level that uses this tileset).
       -This README file. =)
       -And of course the tilesets.
Have fun with this pack

It has been a lot of work because I started this project almost one year ago. Thanks for some support from the HorizonWII.net Discord Sevrer! =)



--IMPORTANT INFO--

DON'T reupload this tileset pack under your name because it was a hard work to do as you will know in more detail in the next line:
INFO: I know that this is mostly just an NSMBU Tileset pack ported to NSMBW but I had to go through many difficult/unavoidable times while porting (mostly when tilesets looked absolutely ugly in RGB565). I even added some custom/missing tiles which was a torture sometimes and I hope you can understand me and give me credit if you're using any of my tilesets.
