--Release - V1.00--
The first official and also maybe final release. Everything is done that needs to be done. Updated many tilesets and added around 15 missing tilesets.
Some tilesets got some tile order changes and some got even redone.
--Release - V1.01--
Changed the flowers because they were a bit pixelated in the tileset images and FINALLY added animated forest flowers. Renamed Pa3_gakel_u to Pa2 AND Pa3_mokuzai_u which means I split it up into two tilesets because some tiles of the original were still missing. Improved some tilesets. Especially the Pa1_obake_soto_u Tileset. Added an extended Version of the Credits tileset.
--Release - V1.02--
Added the source code of the RandTiles.bin file called randtilegen.rb if you want to add other tilesets with randomization. Fixed some typos in the readme.
--Release - V1.03--
Updated the credits tileset to have the 14x2 and 15x2 long grass tiles as well (Thanks to AboodXD (MasterVermilli0n#7241)).
