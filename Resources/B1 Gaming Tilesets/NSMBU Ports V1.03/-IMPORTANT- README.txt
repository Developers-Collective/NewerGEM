This Tileset Pack includes every tileset that exists in NSMBU. It even features some tilesets that were custom made by me.
This tileset Pack also includes:
       - An Animation file called "animTiles.bin" for the NewerRes folder
       - A randomization file called "RandTiles.bin" that you can paste into the NewerRes folder of you game files.
                - There's also the source code of it called randtilegen.rb which you can edit if you have other tilesets than just the NSMBU tilesets from this pack (Thanks to @Mulkaw#6715). Just don't forget to edit the path at the bottom of the file.
       - A randomization file for Reggie called "tilesetinfo.xml" that you can copy and paste into your Patch folder in the reggiedata folder.
       - A tileset list for reggie (Thanks to @Zementblock#4361) called "tilesets.xml" that you can copy and paste in the reggiedata folder if you want and need to.
       - A changelog where you can inform yourself about the updates this tileset pack has gotten.
       - A standard tileset list for you to know which tileset is which (With references to a level that uses this tileset).
       - This README file. =)
Have fun with this pack

It has been a lot of work because I started this project almost one year ago. Thanks for some support from the HorizonWII.net Discord Sevrer! =)



--IMPORTANT INFO--

DON'T reupload this tileset pack under your name because it was a hard work to do as you will know in more detail in the next line:
INFO: I know that this is mostly just an NSMBU Tileset pack ported to NSMBW but I had to go through many difficult/unavoidable times while porting (mostly when tilesets looked absolutely ugly in RGB565 (16-bit colors)). I even added some custom/missing tiles which was a torture sometimes and I hope you can understand me and give me credit if you're using any of my tilesets.
