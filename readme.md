In addition to this, NewerGEM also includes tilesets from all major tileset packs.

Please note that two different branches are planned for NewerGEM:

### Reggie ###
- Copy the game patch "NewerGEM" to your Reggie\reggiedata\patches directory.
All NewerGEM features and included assets should show up when loading the game patch.

### riivolution ###
- Copy the game root directory (\riivolution\NewerGEM) to the root of your SD. Compiled NewerRes and all assets are included.
- Also, make sure to copy the folder with the .xml file to your SD as well (\riivolution\riivolution\NewerGEM.xml).
The usual method with Newer_Mod_ISO_Builder works well to create an ISO.

### Resources ###
In this folder you can find animation data, randomization data, readme's, and other files that belong to the tileset packs.
The actual resources (tilesets) are already included in the game patch.

### Kamek (Clang) ###
All tools should be available to build NewerGEM yourself.
Please follow the steps on the Newer Kamek repository.
