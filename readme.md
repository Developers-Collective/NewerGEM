# Newer General Engine Mod (Resources)#

## Mods explained in more detail: ##
1) Shell Mod SMW Style:
Shells can be thrown up while grabbed and UP is pressed. Koopa/Buzzy Beetle/Spiny shells are supported. Brand new: Bob-ombs and Glow Blocks.
Grabbing the shell again after throwing it was beautifully implemented by Grop. Also, the forward-movement of the shell allows to throw and catch it at any (Mario) speed, even max speed. At slower speeds, the throw arc is reduced accordingly.

2) Yoshi Mod:
Green Shell = Shoots shell
Red Shell: Shoots triple-fire
Shell from blue-coated Koopas = Shoots triple-ice
^^-- this works so far // not implemented --vv
Yellow Shell: Can stomp enemies in a small radius where Yoahi lands
Blue Shell: Can fly (would need to be time-gated)

If down is pressed: Can place shell on the ground (only green/yellow/blue). Does not work yet.

3) Msg Box Mod. Trigger message via events. Works.

4) Credits Editor Mod and Newer Credits Editor Mod. Allows to have one StaffRoll file per level. In combination with the new functions (Wait Forever; Listen for Event and Switch to Scene; Switch Scene and Release Camera) it's possible, to quickly move the player to any other position in the level, show a custom-made image while transitioning (or leave blank), and release the camera at the destination. Or a combination of those features.
It also allows, to show event-triggered text anywhere on screen.
All of this works. But many aspects still untested.

5) Brick Block Mod: More frames! :slight_smile:
